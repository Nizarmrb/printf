FT_PRINTF()

🚀 The goal of this project is pretty straightforward: you will recode printf().

📚 Key Learning Objectives:

    Variable Arguments Mastery: Gain proficiency in handling a variable number of arguments, a fundamental aspect of implementing printf().

🛠️ Approach:

    Understanding Format Specifiers: Get familiar with the various format specifiers (%d, %s, %f, %c, etc.) used in printf() and how to interpret them.

    Variable Argument Handling: Master the usage of variable argument lists (stdarg.h) to handle the variable number of arguments passed to printf().

    String Formatting Skills: Learn the intricacies of string manipulation to format output strings according to the provided format specifiers.

    Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage invalid format strings or insufficient arguments.

    Efficiency and Optimization: Strive for efficiency in terms of time and space complexity, optimizing the code wherever possible.

    Testing and Validation: Develop comprehensive test cases to validate the functionality of the re-implemented printf() under various scenarios.
